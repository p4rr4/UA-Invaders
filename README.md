# UA-Invaders
# Programming 1 Project 2022 by Adrián Tendero García, Alejandro Benito Marcos and Jesús Parra García

  UA Invaders is a recreation of the classic game, Space Invaders, but in this case you will have to defend the University of Alicante from the enemies.
  The game is programmed to run in Ubuntu OS with the X11 library installed and a full-screen terminal zoomed in 3 times.
  Note that if the resolution of the screen or the hardware of the computer is not enough, the game will not run correctly.
  To compile the game, you must have all the files of the main/ folder in the same directory where you compile it.
